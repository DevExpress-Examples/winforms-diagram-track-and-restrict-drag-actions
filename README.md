# WinForms Diagram Control - Track and Restrict Drag Actions

This example restricts different drag actions within the DevExpress [WPF Diagram Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/114833/controls-and-libraries/diagrams).

The `DiagramControl` allows you to use multiple events (raised at different moments in time) to customize/prohibit drag operations:

* The [AddingNewItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramControl.AddingNewItem) event is raised when a user drags a new item to the canvas.
* The [BeforeItemsMoving](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramControl.BeforeItemsMoving) event is raised when a user initiates an item drag/move action. This event allows you to customize dragged items.
* The [DiagramControl.ItemsMoving](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramControl.ItemsMoving) event is raised during item drag/move operations. This event allows you to restrict this action based on stage, item position, and item parent.

By handling these events, you can introduce the following restrictions:

* You cannot drop "Rectangle" and "Ellipse" shapes to the canvas.
* You cannot move the "Triangle" shape once you drop it onto the canvas.
* You cannot move the "RightTriangle" shape to a container if it contains at least one "RightTriangle" shape.
* You cannot drop the "Pentagon" shape near other shapes.
